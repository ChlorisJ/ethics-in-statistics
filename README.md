# The Centerpiece for the Opioid Epidemic 
## Unethical Statistical Practices by Purdue Pharma 

Billion dollar drug maker Purdue Pharma launched a cure for pain but would later become the centerpiece for the opioid epidemic. This is how misleading statistics contributed


The drug maker Purdue Pharma launched OxyContin two decades ago with the claim that OxyContin is a non-addictive opiates painkiller that relieves pain for 12 hours. OxyContin would later become a centerpiece for the opioid epidemic that would continue to escalate into the late 2000 and beyond. 


Before the FDA approval, Purdue conducted a double-blinded, randomized, parallel clinical trial to test the safety and effectiveness of OxyContin. A total of 133 elderly patients were enrolled. Three groups of patients were randomly allocated and dosed every 12 hours with either placebo, 10mg or 20mg OxyContin for 14 days. Outcomes were coded as pain levels: no pain, slight pain, moderate pain, and severe pain. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed to test whether means across the three groups were statistically different1.


Don’t be fooled by buzzwords like ‘double-blinded’ or ‘randomized’, this study raised a couple ethical red flags. 


First, the study is not transparent about the assumptions made in the analysis and the interpretation of results. For example, In the Purdue study, patients were randomly assigned to groups and each group was assigned a treatment. Each patient was to stay in their assigned treatment group for the duration of the study.

The study did not report the degree of freedom in the analysis. However, there is a possibility that the observations are not statistically independent because the measurements are correlated in time. This is the definition of pseudoreplication. Failure to account for pseudoreplication increases the probability of falsely concluding that experimental treatments have real effects2, or statistically speaking, the probability of making a Type I error. The lack of independence in the data may further mislead the result when analyzed in a statistical test (ANCOVA) that assumes independence. Pseudoreplication is one of the most common statistical mistakes in research. In a single issue of Nature Neuroscience, a study found 12% of papers had pseudoreplication and a further 36% were suspected of having pseudoreplication


Second, the study ignored the bias inherited in the missing data. In the study a total of 133 patients were enrolled but only 47% patients (n=63) completed the trial as documented. Around 40% of the patients who discontinued (n=70) reported adverse effects related to the treatment. Yet Purdue concluded quote ‘The result clearly showed that OxyContin is an effective analgesic when administered 12 hours as compared to placebo.


It would be an ethical statistical practice if the sample size, degrees of freedom, the test statistic, and precise p-values are reported. This information should be reported in any study.


In December 1995, OxyContin was approved by the FDA as the first formulation of oxycodone that allowed dosing every 12 hours. At the time of approval, the FDA believed the ‘controlled-release formulation’ would decrease the potency of the drug, which would have less abuse potential4. The formulation would allow the drug to be absorbed slowly without the rush of ‘high’. At least that’s what they thought.


Reality has proven otherwise. It turns out the FDA needs more statisticians.


To start from the beginning, this is what a scientific chart should look like.

All axes are clearly labeled, intuitive and self-explanatory. The units are clearly stated, and the scales are even. Totally normal.


This is what Purdue did.

Purdue knew the data undermined the claim that OxyContin is non-addictive. They made two  unethical mistakes. First they compressed the scales so that it appears that the dosing is smooth across time in the blood level. Second, they also tapered with the scales. Notice on the Y-axis is a log scale. A log scale would drastically reduce the variability in the data. Since the sole purpose is to convey information, a graph that is confusing and misleading is considered unethical. While it can be a bit daunting to think a poorly designed graph is ‘morally wrong’, it is crucial to think of the powerful message it sends to viewers.



The FDA approved regardless. When they finally label-warned the danger of abuse of the drug in 2001. It was too little too late. Many people who later abused OxyContin started by taking a prescribed amount. As their body develops tolerance to the drug, as any opiates would do, they need a higher dose to maintain the same relief or high. From 1999 to 2019, nearly 500,000 people died from an overdose involving opioids, including prescription and illegal opioid5, while Purdue made $12 Billion In profit.
